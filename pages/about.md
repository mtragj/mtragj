<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
Motorcycle Trail Riding Association (MTRA) is a 501 Â©  3 nonprofit organization  representing Western Slope dirt bikers since 1989. We are governed by a volunteer board of directors and funded through annual membership fees, donations, and grants.  We have a highly successful collaborative working relationship with multiple agencies including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Forest Service (USFS), Grand Valley Trail  Association (GVTA), Trails Preservation Alliance (TPA), Colorado Off-Highway Vehicle Coalition (COHVCO) and other user groups.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
MTRA strives to keep all public lands in Western Colorado open to responsible, respectful recreational usage by interactive cooperation with local, State and Federal agencies and other user groups.  Through a combination of volunteer labor, rider/public education and local involvement, MTRA works to advocate for, develop, build, and maintain dedicated single-track trails to ensure the continued success and growth of our sport.
