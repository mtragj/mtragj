Happy New Year!  Hope everyone had a great holiday season.  Just a quick reminder that our first quarterly meeting will be on the 16th of Jan, 6pm at the Edgewater Brewery back room. 

The agenda will include updates from our BLM and USFS partners on their plans for 2024, our Team Leaders will talk about 2023 events and what's coming up in 2024 for group rides and trail work/advocacy, as well as improvements to our website and FB/Instagram page.  We'll close out with an open discussion/Q&A session to get your input on what our focus should be for 2024.

We'll have our new QR membership sign-up forms (only $30!) available at the meeting for your convenience, or you can use the one attached to this email to join up ahead of time.  The form will automatically update your contact info to our membership list, saving you a little time.  We'll also have our new 2024 membership cards available at the meeting, which can be used to obtain discounts at participating local dealers and shops throughout the year.  A full list of participating sponsors will be available at the meeting.

Please pass this info on to all your trail riding friends and family, and bring them to the meeting - the more the better!
